# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

- build dockerfile
- I have used docker before. I got more information about docker this time. Best part i liked is the diff between RUN and CMD

Challenges:
Unable to push to dockerhub directly. had to add tag manually to match with dockerhub to be able to push


### HOMEWORK DONE:
deployed the backend image to dockerhub https://hub.docker.com/r/mdsadiq/experiments/tags  [dockerhub-image](./assets/week-1-local.PNG)

Ran a docker instance locally [run docker locally](./assets/week-1.PNG)
