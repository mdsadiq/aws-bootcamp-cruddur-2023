# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing
Learned a lot about distributed tracing this time.
Though i have worked with cloudwatch when deploying lambda, i realised i did not look at this fine granularity.

I had most fun learning about Observability as a separate topic in itself.
The 3 pillars of observability and their overlap
